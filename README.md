# Network Anomaly Detection

Given a group of events a meteor shower, birth of quadruplets and being struck by lightning how would one categorize them? These items are interesting in nature because of the fact they are rare and deviate from normal behavior. [1] These events are known as anomalies.

In the digital era, we are connected by the internet. Although the internet has assisted in revolutionizing the quality of our lives, we often hear of network intrusions (Equifax, Yahoo email accounts) that wreck the normal functioning of an organization.

In general, according to IBM an organization spends nearly 10% of its yearly revenue in securing its network. This fact led us to think that it becomes imperative that we have a robust system that could potentially identify and thwart such intrusions before they cause havoc. Through this project we attempt to identify anomalies in networds and develop a model that could potentially prevent network attacks at an early stage
